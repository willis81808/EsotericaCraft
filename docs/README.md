## Introduction
This mod introduces a new hard magic system built to maintain a Vanilla-like feel to the game. Runes can be built in the world out of different patterns of Mundane and Enchanted blocks, and when activated with a "Runing Staff" or via redstone have varied useful effects ranging from enabling teleportation between distant locations, protecting your base from griefing and hostile mob spawning, to trapping to souls of mobs, and more!

In addition to the mystical runes, this mod introduces a "sleep vote" system (configurable in-game by operators via the /sleepvote command), and a "chest shop" system whereby players can protect chests from theft as well as automatically facilitate trade without the owner having to rely on trust or even needing to be present for the transaction at all!

## Runes

Rune recipes will be added here in the future...
